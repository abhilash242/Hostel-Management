# Hostel-Complain-System

The aim of this project was to build a website for students which enables 
students to file hostel related complaints online. A website using which we aim to 
provide a helping hand for students as well as workers so that the students do not 
have to worry about problems that are not in their hands and also workers don’t 
have a problem in sorting the wide array of problems/complaints reported in a hostel like 
environment. The aim of the project is to make a software/technological system 
which allows the students to file a complaint online and assign the complaints 
directly to workers according to the nature of the work.

When we started our hostel life, we were forced to face the changes and 
adapt to a totally different surrounding this accompanied with the issues inside 
the hostel room caused physical as well as mental stress Hence, we set out to 
provide a solution for students so that we can help them in conveying the problem 
or issue that they face in their daily hostel life, We also aim to provide a service 
that at the same time provides a platform on which workers can find sorted 
complains from the said students. Our website also aims in assisting the admins 
in the payment process of the workers as the workers that have completed and not 
completed the said complaints have been sorted. 
V-HELP is a website using which we aim to provide a helping hand 
for students as well as workers so that the students do not have to worry about 
problems that are not in their hand and also workers don’t have a problem in 
sorting the wide array of problems reported in a hostel like environment.
